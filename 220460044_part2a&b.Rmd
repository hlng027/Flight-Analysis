```{r}
library(dplyr)
```

### Delay by time of day
```{r}
# Loop through each year
for (i in 1991:2000) {
  
  # Read data for the current year
  ontime <- read.csv(paste0(i, ".csv"), header = TRUE)
  
  # Calculate TimeOfDayGroup
  ontime$TimeOfDayGroup <- cut(as.numeric(substr(ontime$DepTime, 1, 2)),
                               breaks = c(-Inf, 6, 12, 18, Inf),
                               labels = c("Night", "Morning", "Afternoon", "Evening"))
  
  # Group by TimeOfDayGroup and calculate average delay for each year
  daydelay <- ontime %>%
    group_by(TimeOfDayGroup) %>%
    summarize(AvgDelay = mean(ArrDelay, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
    arrange(AvgDelay)
  
  print(daydelay)
}
```

### Delay by days of week
```{r}
for (i in c(1991:2000)) {
  ontime <- read.csv(paste0(i, ".csv"), header = TRUE)
  
  # Group by DayOfWeek and calculate average delay
  weekdelay <- ontime %>%
    group_by(DayOfWeek) %>%
    summarize(AvgDelay = mean(ArrDelay, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
    arrange(AvgDelay)
  
  print(weekdelay)
}
```

### Delay by month
```{r}
for (i in c(1991:2000)) {
  ontime <- read.csv(paste0(i, ".csv"), header = TRUE)
  
  # Group by Month and calculate average delay
  monthdelay <- ontime %>%
    group_by(Month) %>%
    summarize(AvgDelay = mean(ArrDelay, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
    arrange(AvgDelay)
  
  print(monthdelay)
}
```


## (b)

### Read csv file
```{r}
planes_df <- read.csv("plane-data.csv", header = TRUE)
```

### Delay with Plane Age
```{r}
results <- list()

# Loop over each year
for (i in c(1991:2000)) {

  planes_year <- planes_df %>%
    mutate(
      ManufacturingDate = as.Date(issue_date, format = "%d/%m/%Y"),
      PlaneAge = i - as.numeric(format(ManufacturingDate, "%Y"))
    ) %>%
    filter(PlaneAge >= 0)
  
  # Select only the columns you need from planes_year
  planes_year_subset <- planes_year %>%
    select(tailnum, PlaneAge)

  # Join the data frames
  ontime_age <- inner_join(ontime, planes_year_subset, by = c("TailNum" = "tailnum"))

  # Calculate average delay for the current year
  agedelay_year <- ontime_age %>%
    group_by(PlaneAge) %>%
    summarize(AvgTotalDelay = mean(DepDelay + ArrDelay, na.rm = TRUE))
  
  # Store the result in the list
  results[[as.character(i)]] <- agedelay_year
  
}

# Print the results
for (i in c(1991:2001)) {
  print(results[[as.character(i)]])
}
```

### Focusing on year 2000
```{r}
# Drawing the graph
ggplot(agedelay_year, aes(x = PlaneAge, y = AvgTotalDelay)) +
  geom_line() +
  labs(title = "Average Delay by Plane Age (Year 2000)",
       x = "Plane Age",
       y = "Average Delay")

# Count the number of flights for each plane age group in the year 2000
flight_counts <- ontime_age %>%
  group_by(PlaneAge) %>%
  summarize(NumFlights = n())

# Create a bar plot for the number of flights by plane age group
ggplot(flight_counts, aes(x = factor(PlaneAge), y = NumFlights)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", fill = "skyblue") +
  labs(title = "Number of Flights by Plane Age (Year 2000)",
       x = "Plane Age",
       y = "Number of Flights") +
  theme_minimal()
```
